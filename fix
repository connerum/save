How to Fix It
1. Rename or Share the Printer
Go to Control Panel → Devices and Printers (or Settings → Bluetooth & Devices → Printers & Scanners).
Right-click the ZDesigner ZD411 printer, choose Printer properties → Sharing.
Check “Share this printer” and give it a share name (e.g. ZD411ZPL).
Then run:
batch
Copy code
print /D:"\\%COMPUTERNAME%\ZD411ZPL" "C:\Path\To\labels.zpl"
This often solves the issue, because now print sees a share name instead of a raw USB device.
